# Sentence Auto-Completion Using NLP

## Overview
This project implements a Sentence Auto-Completion model using Natural Language Processing techniques. The model predicts the next word in a sequence based on the input context. It is built using TensorFlow and Keras and trained on a large text corpus.

## Features
- Text cleaning to preprocess the input data.
- Tokenization of text to convert words into numerical representations.
- Generation of n-grams for training the model.
- LSTM architecture for handling sequence prediction tasks.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NLTK
- NumPy
- Pandas

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. It is recommended to use a virtual environment.

### Install Required Libraries
You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow nltk pandas numpy
